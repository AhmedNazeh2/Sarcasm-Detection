Overview
This project aims to detect sarcasm in text using a dataset of news headlines. The dataset includes sarcastic headlines from The Onion and non-sarcastic headlines from HuffPost. We will utilize Word2Vec and GloVe embeddings to represent the text data and compare their effectiveness in classifying sarcasm.

Dataset
Size: Approximately 28,000 text data points.
Categories:
Sarcastic: Headlines from The Onion that are intended to convey sarcasm.
Not Sarcastic: Real news headlines collected from HuffPost.
Data Sources
Sarcastic Headlines: Collected from The Onion (News in Brief and News in Photos categories).
Non-Sarcastic Headlines: Collected from HuffPost.
Methodology
Preprocessing:

Clean and tokenize the text data.
Convert text to lowercase and remove punctuation.
(Optional) Remove stopwords if necessary for the analysis.
Embeddings:

Word2Vec: Train a Word2Vec model on the dataset or use pre-trained vectors.
GloVe: Train a GloVe model or utilize pre-trained vectors to capture global word relationships.
Model Training:

Implement machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, SVM, or neural networks) using both embedding techniques.
Train and evaluate the models on the dataset.


Evaluation Metrics
We will use the following metrics to evaluate model performance:

Accuracy: Overall correctness of the predictions.
Precision: True positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives.
Recall: True positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives.
F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Results
After running the evaluation script, the results for both Word2Vec and GloVe embeddings will be displayed, allowing for direct comparison of their effectiveness in sarcasm detection.

Conclusion
This project provides insights into the use of different word embedding techniques for sarcasm detection in news headlines. By analyzing the performance of Word2Vec and GloVe, we aim to understand which method is more effective in capturing the nuances of sarcasm in text.
